# Simple To-do List

*training project*

#### Hey there guys,

This mini-project is actually a training job done as a homework (as I'm new to all this and in the process of learning).

This is all done in elementary-level HTML, CSS and pure JavaScipt.   
I'd be more than glad if anyone would check it out and kindly leave a comment or drop a suggestion if you have any.

> This project is done in Persian language. If I find the time, I may consider making this in English.

> Contact me if you want to contribute, and feel free to use my code to make your own english version (although a mention somewhere in your README file would be highly appeciated).

Feel free to contact me if you have any problems understanding what I did.

Regards,   
**Mehrdad**

*(an **@impostorfella** project)*
